1.cpp The legs of a right-angled triangle are given. Write a C++ program that find its hypotenuse and area.

2.cpp You are given real numbers x and y. Write a C++ program that finds the maximum of them

3.cpp A natural number n is given. Evaluate 2 in power of n without using already implemented functions

4.cpp A natural number n is given. Calculate n! (n factorial)  without using already implemented functions

5.cpp Write a C/ C++ program to calculate the number of points with integer coordinates that fall within a circle of radius R centered at the origin. R > 0 is given.

6.cpp There is a brick with sides a, b, c and a rectangular hole in the wall with sides d, e. Write a C ++ program that determines if a brick will pass through a hole.

7.cpp The coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) of two fields of the chessboard are given (as numbers from 1 to 8). Write a C++ programm, that determines whether the knight can move from one of these squares to another in one move.

8.cpp A square matrix of real numbers is given. Find the transposed matrix

9.cpp Random numbers a, b, c are given. If there is a triangle with sides a, b, c, then determine which triangle it is: equilateral, isosceles or versatile. If the triangle does not exist, display an appropriate message.

10.cpp Write a C/C++ program which find an average value of the array elements. The array Length is N.

11.cpp Write a C/C++ program which summarize elements at the same indexes of the two arrays a[] and b[]. the result will be stored in the 3rd array. c[0] = a[0] + b[0] and etc..

12.cpp Convert meters per second to miles per second and express in kilometers per minute.

13.cpp Write a program that calculates the product of all negative array elements. The array and its length are entered by the user.

14.cpp Write a program that selects words with an odd number of letters in the text entered from the keyboard and displays the result on the screen.

15.cpp,  The practical part must be taken from #14, supplementing it with some conditions:
• the input data is a file; (15_input.txt)
• work results are written to another file; (15_output.txt)
• input data is not limited to one line.
